# EmojiProject

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a NLP model to rewrite a set of texts by 
interjecting emojis in specific locations. We have chosen a word-embedding approach 
to be trained on a set of texts to first learn the relationships of emoji to text.
Then, we develop a strategy to choose locations to inject emojis, choosing the best
fit from the model, and lastly we evaluate the performance of our model to find
areas of improvement.

This project is written with Python 3.
